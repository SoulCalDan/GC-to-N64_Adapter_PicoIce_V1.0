# GC-to-N64_Adapter_PicoIce_V1.0
Variant of my adapter using the pico-ice FPGA

This code is rewritten for the pico-ice FPGA dev board. I am rewriting a lot of it (mostly thru parameter changes) to be compatible with future boards like the Tang Nano 9k.

This code is also written in the Lattice Radiant software instead of the VS Code software. Synthesis times are FAR superior in the Radiant software than VS Code.

Total usage at the moment is around 2600 4LUTs.
